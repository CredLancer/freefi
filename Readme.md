Smart Contracts 
Get a loan 
This contract allows users to borrow and repay funds.
This smart contract is a basic lending platform written in Solidity. It allows users to borrow funds from a lender and repay the borrowed amount. Key features include tracking user balances, borrowed amounts, and the status of active loans.
	•			Deployment Information:
	•	If you have deployed the contract using Remix or a development environment, check the deployment logs or transaction details for the deployed contract's address.
	•			Blockchain Explorer:
	•	Use a blockchain explorer like Avalanche Explorer (for Avalanche C-Chain), Etherscan (for Ethereum), or other explorers for specific blockchains.
	•	Search for your contract address on the respective explorer to find deployment details.
	•			Record Keeping:
	•	Maintain a record of contract deployments, including contract addresses, deployment dates, and networks (e.g., Avalanche Fuji C-Chain, Ethereum, XDC, Celo, etc.).
In this Smart Contract we deployed it on Avalanche Fuji C-Chain (address: 0xddB6BA183a73a6418eDa8a0feb812ED57116Aa3e)
